# Get your meals recipe on-the-go by just surfing the internet

How great would it be if whenever you want to prepare/cook a delicacy, you just open a web app and check for instructions on how to cook the food.

In this app, we render popular western meals and provide instructions by which you can follow to prepare a nice delicacy. These meals were gotten from an external API (https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=).

This app also gives you the function to search on the go for whatever meal you are looking for or you probably want to get funky and just work with a random meal. There's the option for you to select random meals.

# You also get the option to add/remove foods to/from the favorites. SUPER, isn't it?

The localStorage was used to store whatever food you decide to add to favorites and also removing it in the app removes it from the localStorage.

The context API was used to pass majority of the functionalities down to each omponent ensuring simplicity in the code.

The blend of good UI and easy-to-use functionality of this applicationwith clean, simple and bug-free code makes this a very resourceful and beautiful applicationüòç.
